# RAPID: Rust Authentication with Post-quantum Identity in Distributed environments

This project is a Rust-based server-side application designed to run on Cloudflare Workers. It includes features for user authentication, session management, and secure token handling using post-quantum cryptography.

## Features

- User Registration and Login
- Secure Token Generation and Validation
- Session Management
- Post-Quantum Cryptographic Signatures with `pqc_dilithium`
- Async/Await Support for Non-Blocking Operations
- Integration with Cloudflare Workers

## Security Features

RAPID leverages advanced security protocols and state-of-the-art cryptographic practices to ensure the highest level of security, especially concerning future quantum computing threats:

- **Quantum Computing Threat**: Quantum computing introduces specific attack vectors against cryptographic algorithms. Quantum computers could efficiently execute algorithms like Shorâ€™s algorithm, which can factor large integers and compute discrete logarithms rapidly. This capability undermines the security of RSA and ECC-based systems, which are widely used in JWTs for signature verification and encryption. As a result, quantum computers could potentially decrypt sensitive information and forge authentications by breaking these foundational cryptographic systems.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Utilizes [pqc_dilithium](https://github.com/Argyle-Software/dilithium/), a cryptographic library offering resistance against quantum-computing attacks, ensuring long-term security of authentication tokens.
- **Secure Token Handling**: Implements robust methods for generating and validating tokens, providing a secure layer for user authentication and session management.
- **Cloudflare Workers Integration**: Leverages the security and scalability of Cloudflare Workers, ensuring reliable and secure deployments.

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo
- Cloudflare Workers Account
- [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) CLI for Cloudflare

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kibernetikos/rapid.git
    cd rapid
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cargo update
    ```

## Configuration

Set up your environment variables in Cloudflare Workers according to your needs. The application requires the following environment configurations:

- D1

## Deployment

Deploy the application to Cloudflare Workers using the `wrangler` CLI:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Usage

The application exposes the following endpoints:

- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and receive an access and refresh token.
- `GET /me`: Retrieve information about the currently authenticated user.
